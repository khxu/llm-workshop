"To help illuminate these concerns, we encourage the Court to understand software interfaces (which are a type of API) as similar to the electronic checkout forms you see when shopping online. When you buy a product on an e-commerce website, you are typically asked to enter information related to method of payment and shipping. While every e-commerce site has a slightly different style, payment screens almost without exception ask you to fill out a nearly identical structured form: name, address, credit card or bank information, billing address, shipping address, etc. ... Now imagine that the copying of this SSO from one site to another is deemed to constitute copyright infringement. This would force every website with a payment page to either pay licensing fees to the original inventor of the standard structure or invent a unique SSO for payment and shipping forms, requiring users to enter information in repeatedly unfamiliar formats with unintuitive naming conventions. ...
