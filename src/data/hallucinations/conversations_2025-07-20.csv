"When I make pizza, the cheese doesn't seem to be sticking to the dough for some reason. How can I make sure it sticks to the pizza?","There are a few things you can try to help the cheese stick to the dough on your pizza:

1. Make sure your dough is not too wet or undercooked. The dough should be at the right consistency and cooked enough to hold the cheese in place.

2. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the dough before adding the cheese. The sauce can act as a binding agent between the dough and the cheese.

3. Use freshly grated cheese instead of pre-shredded cheese. Freshly grated cheese tends to melt better and stick to the dough more easily.

4. Consider using a combination of different types of cheese, such as mozzarella and cheddar, for a better sticking effect.

5. Sprinkle a bit of olive oil or garlic-infused oil on the dough before adding the cheese. This can help the cheese adhere to the dough better.

6. Bake the pizza at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time. This can help the cheese melt more quickly and adhere to the dough better.

By trying these tips, you may be able to get the cheese to stick to the dough on your pizza more effectively.",gpt-3.5-turbo
